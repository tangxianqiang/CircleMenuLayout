## description
1、This view is based on someone other's idea.The core of the idea is that we change the view by "onLayout" rather than by "onDraw".
<br>2、Some list like RecyclerView uses scrap and recycler to cache views.However this view doesn't cache view,it only cache data.it means that we can't change the image of it's view.
## note
This view is not easy to change.So,it is just a view with high coupling.You should understand the view before using it.
